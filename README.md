# Waf2Py Modsecurity v3
Waf2Py is a nice and easy to use web interface for modsecurity v3 with nginx connector. Waf2Py is free and powered by Web2Py that controls modsecurity and nginx configuration in an easy way, allowing you to configure protection for any web application in just minutes.

## What can I do with this interface?

- Create a site in just minutes
- Create global or local exclusions with just 2 clicks
- Add virtual interfaces
- Create static routes for the desired app
- Check debug, access, error and audit logs in an easy way
- Download logs
- Check the stats for every application with nice graphics
- Disable/Enable protection with just 1 click
- Restrict paths or files
- Insert headers



## Installing steps

```
git clone --branch waf2py_modsec3 --single-branch https://github.com/ITSec-Chile/Waf2Py.git
cd Waf2Py
su root
chmod +x waf2py_installer.sh
./waf2py_installer.sh
```
once is installed go to:
```
https://serverip:62443
Login:
admin:admin (don't forget to change this password!)
next step:
go to system --> manage engine --> start engine (this will start nginx, then you can add an application)
```

## Status box explanation
```
Not Running = Nginx not running
Running but not listening = Nginx running but no web app created
Running and Listening = Nginx is running an there is at least 1 web app running
```

## Creating a website
```
1 - Create a virtual IP
      --> Interfaces menu

2 - Create a new app
      --> Click "Deploy" button

3 - Configure the new app
      --> Websites running menu
      --> Click over the application
      --> Configure the backend
      --> Configure ports
      --> Configure certificates if ssl ports are set (leave it blank if you dont need https ports, same thing apply to http ports)
      --> Choose a virtual ip (previusly created on Interfaces menu)
      --> Press the "play" button to enable the new app
      --> Done.
```

## Built With

* [Web2Py](http://www.web2py.com/) - The web framework used
* [Modsecurity v3](https://www.modsecurity.org/) - WAF Engine
* [Openresty](https://openresty.org/) - Reverse proxy
* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) - Webserver to hold Web2Py
* [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/) - Template in the web interface


## About this bundle
```
Tested in Debian 9 (No docker).
Components for this build:
Waf2Py App
Web2Py 2.17.2
Nginx version: openresty-1.13.6.2
ModSecurity v3 - libsecurity;
Modsecurity Nginx connector
OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)



```

<b>Note 1</b>: By now not all options of nginx and modsecurity are implemented with nice switches. Advanced configurations can be made throught the "expert configuration" tab.

<b>Note 2</b>: Every action you perform in the web interface will be saved and logged. nginx will check its configuration syntax first, if the configuration is not correct, nginx will not be reloaded. If you do something wrong in the configuration files, it doesnâ€™t matter. Nginx will reload and apply the new changes only if the syntax of the configuration files is correct.

<b>Note 3</b>: Due to nginx connector is still being improved, maybe not all functions works as expected, but with the time this will be better and better.

## Support
We invite you to test and support this development to make something powerfull and free.

## RoadMap

### Stage I (done)

```
- [x] Move to ModSecurity 3
```

### Stage II 

```
- [ ] Parsing logs and update dashboard with a cron job (by now logs are being parsed and the dashboard is updated when click the magnifying glass icon)
- [ ] Server Cloacking (Header Rewrite)
- [ ] Improve user experience
- [ ] Fail2ban integration
- [ ] GeoIP Blocking
- [ ] IP Reputation 
- [ ] Cookie and URL Encryption
- [ ] More cool features
```
